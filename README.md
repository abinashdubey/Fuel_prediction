This data science project aims to analyze the fuel consumption of the latest cars and identify the
factors that affect it. The project utilizes a dataset that includes information such as the car's make,
model, engine size, transmission type, fuel type, an d fuel consumption (in liters per 100 kilometers).
The data will be analyzed using various statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to
identify patterns, correlations, and trends. The project seeks to provide insights into the industry's
prog ress towards meeting fuel efficiency and emission goals, and to inform car manufacturers,
policymakers, and consumers in making informed decisions regarding car purchases and
environmental impact. The findings of this project can contribute to a sustainabl e future and help
mitigate the environmental impact of the automobile industry.
